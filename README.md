# [Plant Baby](https://plant-baby-ag.web.app/)

Plant Baby was my final project as a student at Boca Code. The goal was to give users information about specific plants to give them suffiecient care to survive.

## Getting Started
In order to create this web app, a couple packages needed to be installed before continuing:

### Firebase Authentication

- firebase
- firebase/auth

### Material UI's component library

- @mui/material

 ## Exploring the App
You are immediately taken to the homepage where it gives a brief description on what the app is about and what you can do on it. Once you scroll to the bottom you can immediately go to the plant list or you can create an account
